            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p style="color: #0be4ec;">
                During my undergraduate years at Jain University, I co-founded 8-Bit, a student society dedicated to
                pushing the boundaries of design and technology. As the Technical Head, I was deeply involved in
                transforming 8-Bit into a vibrant community where students could dive into their passions for gaming,
                graphic design, web development, video editing, and social media management. We built a collaborative
                environment that encouraged innovation and creative exploration.

                The following logo represents the Music Team of our university, and I had the opportunity to design it.

            <p style="color: #0be4ec;">In my role, I orchestrated a variety of projects sourced from university forums
                and clubs, where I oversaw the technical aspects of these initiatives. This included designing backdrops
                and video advertisements for university events, ensuring that our work not only met the high standards
                expected but also enhanced the visual appeal of these events. Additionally, I was responsible for
                developing websites for interuniversity festivals, which involved coordinating with different teams to
                ensure that the websites were functional, user-friendly, and aligned with the event’s branding.</p>

            <h2>What I learned</h2>
            <p style="color: #0be4ec;">
                Being the Technical Head of 8-Bit was a huge learning experience for me. I got to work on a variety of
                projects that pushed me to develop my skills in web development, video production, and project
                management. I also learned how to lead a team and manage multiple projects at once, making sure
                everything was completed on time and to a high standard. This experience really fueled my passion for
                technology and design and gave me a solid foundation in managing and executing creative projects.
