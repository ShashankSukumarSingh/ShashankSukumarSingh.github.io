            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p style="color: #0be4ec;">
                During my tenure as the Social Media and Marketing Head at T-Interiors, I was responsible for driving
                the company’s digital presence and branding efforts. Leading a team of four, I spearheaded the design
                and production of key branding materials, including logos, brochures, visiting cards, and social media
                posts. These materials were essential in establishing a cohesive brand identity and ensuring consistent
                messaging across all platforms.

        <section class="game-mechanics">

            <p style="color: #0be4ec;">In addition to overseeing design work, I played a crucial role in content
                creation by editing and designing video content for social media and advertisements. These videos were
                strategically crafted to engage our target audience, enhance brand visibility, and drive customer
                interaction. My responsibilities also included ensuring that our social media platforms were
                consistently updated with fresh, relevant content, keeping our audience engaged and informed.</p>

                pages. These campaigns were instrumental in generating leads and boosting overall brand awareness.</p>

            <p style="color: #0be4ec;">
                In this role, I gained significant experience in leading a creative team and managing comprehensive
                marketing campaigns. I developed a deep understanding of how to create and maintain a strong brand
