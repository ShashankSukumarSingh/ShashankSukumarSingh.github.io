        <h1>Rift of the Realms</h1>
        <p>Rift of the Realms delves into the timeless conflict between light and dark, good and evil. Players are
            thrust into a world where they must choose allegiance to either the radiant Light Realm or the ominous Dark
            Realm. The objective is to silence the opposing realm to ensure the survival of their own. To achieve this,
            players must breach the dimensional barrier, infiltrate enemy realm.</p>

                <p>Machine parts and repair progress are tracked via PUN RPCs, ensuring that all players receive
                    real-time updates on each other's actions. Here is an example of the code for spawning repairable
                    machines:
                    To maintain player data across sessions, we integrated a REST API using Laravel, ensuring seamless
                    data retrieval and storage.
                    I designed intuitive UI elements using Adobe Illustrator, ensuring clear navigation and enhancing
                    player engagement.

            <h2>What I learned</h2>
            <p>
                During the development of Rift of Realms, I had the opportunity to dive deep into the process of
                creating online multiplayer games using Unity and Photon PUN. This experience taught me how to manage
                real-time interactions effectively. I also worked on the backend, where I learned to integrate databases
                with XAMPP and the Laravel framework, ensuring our game ran smoothly. Additionally, I explored the use
                of VFX particles in Unity, which added a new level of visual appeal to the gameplay. Designing the
                game's UI allowed me to apply and deepen my understanding of Game UI principles, resulting in a
                user-friendly and visually engaging interface. Collaborating closely with a team of five was invaluable,
                as it strengthened my ability to work within a team environment, improving our communication and
                coordination throughout the project. This project was a comprehensive learning experience, helping me
                grow both technically and as a team player in game development.
