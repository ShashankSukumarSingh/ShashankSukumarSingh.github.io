                <p style="color: #0be4ec;">Rift of the Realms delves into the timeless conflict between light and
                    dark,
                    good and evil. Players
                    are
                    thrust into a world where they must choose allegiance to either the radiant Light Realm or the
                    ominous Dark
                    Realm. The objective is to silence the opposing realm to ensure the survival of their own. To
                    achieve this,
                    players must breach the dimensional barrier, infiltrate enemy realm.</p>

            <h2>Game Mechanics and Objective System</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Light Realm: Players must collect machine parts scattered across the map and repair machines
                    before
                    the timer runs out. This requires teamwork and coordination.</li>
                <li>Dark Realm: This faction's players need to use strategic positioning and combat to thwart the
                    Light
                    Realm's efforts, creating a dynamic and tense gameplay experience.</li>

                <p style="color: #0be4ec;">Machine parts and repair progress are tracked via PUN RPCs, ensuring that
                    all
                    players receive
                    real-time updates on each other's actions.
                    To maintain player data across sessions, we integrated a REST API using Laravel, ensuring
                    seamless
                    data retrieval and storage.
                    I designed intuitive UI elements using Adobe Illustrator, ensuring clear navigation and
                    enhancing
                    player engagement.

            <h2>What I learned</h2>
            <p style="color: #0be4ec;">
                During the development of Rift of Realms, I had the opportunity to dive deep into the process of
                creating online multiplayer games using Unity and Photon PUN. This experience taught me how to
                manage
                real-time interactions effectively. I also worked on the backend, where I learned to integrate
                databases
                with XAMPP and the Laravel framework, ensuring our game ran smoothly. Additionally, I explored the
                use
                of VFX particles in Unity, which added a new level of visual appeal to the gameplay. Designing the
                game's UI allowed me to apply and deepen my understanding of Game UI principles, resulting in a
                user-friendly and visually engaging interface. Collaborating closely with a team of five was
                invaluable,
                as it strengthened my ability to work within a team environment, improving our communication and
                coordination throughout the project. This project was a comprehensive learning experience, helping
                me
                grow both technically and as a team player in game development.
