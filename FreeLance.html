        <section class="game-mechanics">
            <h3 style="color: #ceec0b;">Introduction</a></h3>
            <p style="color: #0be4ec;">Over the past six years, I’ve had the privilege of working as a freelance
                designer, completing over 200 projects that have allowed me to explore and expand my creative
                abilities. My freelance work has been incredibly diverse, ranging from UI design and logo creation
                to poster design and video editing. I've also worked on projects requiring basic VFX editing, where
                I added impactful effects to elevate the visual quality of the content.
                One of the most thrilling parts of my freelance career has been designing promotional ads with
                motion graphics. These projects have let me combine my artistic vision with technical skills to
                create captivating, dynamic visuals that grab attention and leave a lasting impression. Each project
                has presented its own challenges, from crafting a user-friendly interface to breathing life into a
                brand through motion graphics.
                Freelancing has been a journey of constant learning and adaptation, requiring me to manage a variety
                of client needs, meet tight deadlines, and consistently deliver work that exceeds expectations. This
                experience has made me a versatile and creative professional, always ready to tackle new challenges
                and push the boundaries of design.

            <h2>What I learned</h2>
            <p style="color: #0be4ec;">
                During the development of Rift of Realms, I had the opportunity to dive deep into the process of
                creating online multiplayer games using Unity and Photon PUN. This experience taught me how to
                manage
                real-time interactions effectively. I also worked on the backend, where I learned to integrate
                databases
                with XAMPP and the Laravel framework, ensuring our game ran smoothly. Additionally, I explored the
                use
                of VFX particles in Unity, which added a new level of visual appeal to the gameplay. Designing the
                game's UI allowed me to apply and deepen my understanding of Game UI principles, resulting in a
                user-friendly and visually engaging interface. Collaborating closely with a team of five was
                invaluable,
                as it strengthened my ability to work within a team environment, improving our communication and
                coordination throughout the project. This project was a comprehensive learning experience, helping
                me
                grow both technically and as a team player in game development.
