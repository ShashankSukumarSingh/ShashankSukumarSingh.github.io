                <p style="color: #0be4ec;">During a 48-hour game jam organized by Games Inkubator at Kingston
                    University, our team developed ECHO, a medieval escape room-style game centered around the theme
                    "Everything Falling Apart." In the game, players explore a forbidden castle and, after interacting
                    with a mysterious painting, are transported through a time portal, trapping them in another era. As
                    the character navigates the room, the light gradually fades, making it increasingly difficult to
                    find the broken pieces of the painting needed to escape.</p>

            <h2>My Contributions</h2>
            <ul>
                <p style="color: #0be4ec;">As the lead programmer, I was responsible for coding the game mechanics in
                    C#. I focused on the lighting system, which was crucial to the gameplay—gradually dimming the light
                    to increase the challenge as players raced against time. This feature was integral to maintaining
                    the tension and atmosphere that our game designer envisioned.
                    I also added a camera shake effect to enhance the game's immersion during critical moments, making
                    the experience more dynamic. Additionally, I designed the game’s UI using Adobe Illustrator,
                    ensuring it was intuitive and aligned with the medieval theme. The animations were created in Maya,
                    which added a polished, professional feel to the game. Working on ECHO was an excellent opportunity
                    to combine my programming and design skills, while collaborating closely with a talented team under
                    tight deadlines.

            <h2>What I learned</h2>
            <p style="color: #0be4ec;">
                This game jam provided valuable lessons in both teamwork and technical execution. Collaborating in a
                high-pressure, time-constrained environment reinforced the importance of clear communication and staying
                aligned with the team’s creative vision. Coding the fading light mechanics and integrating other effects
                in C# taught me a lot about balancing gameplay elements to create a cohesive and immersive experience.
                Designing the UI in Adobe Illustrator and working with Maya for animations gave me deeper insights into
                how different tools and techniques come together in game development. Overall, this project strengthened
                my ability to adapt quickly, think creatively, and deliver quality work under pressure.
