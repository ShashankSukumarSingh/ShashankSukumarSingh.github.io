            <ul>
                <p style="color: #0be4ec;">At The Yellow Ribbon, I had the opportunity to dive deep into the world of
                    graphic design in a professional setting. As a Graphic Design Intern, I was entrusted with creating
                    ID cards for employees, a task that required a keen eye for detail and an understanding of the
                    company's branding. Utilizing Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, I designed ID cards that not only
                    served a functional purpose but also reflected the company's identity.
                    Beyond this, I was actively involved in crafting visually engaging social media posts. These designs
                    were integral to the company’s online presence, helping to enhance brand visibility and engagement.
                    Additionally, I took on the challenge of formatting and publishing research reports on the company’s
                    website, ensuring that the content was both visually appealing and easy to navigate for users.

        <h1>Graphic Design Intern, Prana by Dimple, Mumbai, India</h1>

                <p style="color: #0be4ec;">My internship at Prana by Dimple was a dynamic and creatively stimulating
                    experience. I collaborated closely with a full-stack developer to design the UI of the company’s
                    website using Adobe Illustrator. This role required not only a strong sense of aesthetics but also
                    an understanding of user experience design, ensuring that the final product was both visually
                    appealing and easy to navigate.

                <p style="color: #0be4ec;">In addition to UI design, I was responsible for creating a range of
                    promotional materials, including brochures, social media carousels, and emailers. These materials
                    were key to the company’s marketing efforts, helping to convey their brand message effectively to a
                    wide audience. My work extended to video editing as well, where I utilized Adobe Premiere Pro and
                    After Effects to create compelling video ads that captured the essence of the brand and engaged
                    viewers across digital platforms.

                This internship significantly expanded my skill set in both graphic and video design. I gained valuable
                experience in UI design, working closely with a developer to bring a cohesive vision to life. The
                creation of promotional materials taught me how to design with a marketing focus, ensuring that every
                piece of content was aligned with the brand's goals. Video editing with Adobe Premiere Pro and After
                Effects was particularly rewarding, as I learned how to create engaging and dynamic content that
                resonates with audiences. Overall, this internship not only refined my design skills but also deepened
