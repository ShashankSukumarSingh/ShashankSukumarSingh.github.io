            <h2>Aims and Objectives</h2>
            <p>The primary goal of Level Craft was to develop a system capable of procedurally generating dynamic game
                levels, with a focus on dungeons and room layouts. The objectives were:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Loading and preprocessing datasets for training.</li>
                <li>Designing and training DNN models with Keras for dungeon and room generation.</li>
                <li>Evaluating the performance of these models.</li>
                <li>Developing a Unity-based application to visualize the generated levels, integrating Flask for
                    backend operations.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Analysis and Development</h2>
            <ul>
                <p style="color: #0be4ec;">Several DNN models, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and
                    Variational Autoencoders
                    (VAEs), were designed and trained using Keras within TensorFlow. Dungeon generation models utilized
                    PixelCNN and GANs, while room generation employed VAEs and GANs. Each model was rigorously trained
                    and tested, with the best-performing models selected for integration into the final application.
                    Training methodologies included the use of data augmentation to improve model generalization. The
                    training process involved optimizing hyperparameters such as learning rates and loss functions to
                    ensure the best possible performance. The models were evaluated on their ability to generate
                    high-quality dungeons and rooms that met specific design criteria.

            <h2>Interactive Application and GUI</h2>
            <ul>
                <p style="color: #0be4ec;">The interactive application was developed using Unity, with a REST API
                    backend built using Flask.
                    This setup allowed seamless integration of AI-generated content into the Unity environment. The
                    application enables users to select different dungeon and room models, generate new levels, and view
                    the results directly in Unity. The combination of Flask and Unity provided a robust platform for
                    real-time interaction with the AI models.

            <h2>My Contributions</h2>
            <p style="color: #0be4ec;">
                In the Level Craft project, I was instrumental in researching and selecting the most suitable DNN
                models, utilizing Keras for model development. I contributed to the training process, focusing on data
                augmentation techniques to enhance room generation. I experimented with various models, including
                Conditional GANs for dungeon creation, and trained room models using PixelCNN and GANs. Additionally, I
                played a key role in evaluating the models, helping to develop metrics for assessing their performance.
                I also made significant contributions to the design and UI of the Unity application, using Adobe
                Illustrator to create UI elements that enhanced the overall user experience. My work on the Flask
                backend ensured smooth communication between the AI models and the Unity interface, making the
                application both functional and user-friendly.

            <h2>What I learnt</h2>
            <p style="color: #0be4ec;">
                This project provided me with in-depth experience in using Keras and TensorFlow for procedural content
                generation in games. I learned how to design, train, and optimize DNN models, and integrate them into a
                real-world application using Flask and Unity. My skills in data augmentation, model evaluation, and UI
                design were significantly enhanced. Additionally, working within a team environment on this project
                improved my ability to collaborate effectively and manage complex, multi-faceted tasks.
